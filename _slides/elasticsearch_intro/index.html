These won't be covered in this section (but already on my radar!)

- FP Language
- FP Design Pattern
- FP Data Structures
- FP w/ OOP
- Success Stories

???

FP Language
- Stickly speaking, there is not such a thing as FP language.
  However, some language works better w/ FP paradian
- Some very silly example about Haskell but focus will be on the FP principles

FP Data Structures
- Persistent Data Structure

# What's Functional Programing?

> In computer science, functional programming is **a programming paradigm** 
  that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids
  changing-state and mutable data. [1]

.footnote[[1] [Wikipedia - Functional Programining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)]

???

- FP has its origins in lambda calculus ...
- FP is a programing paradign, rooted in math, lang-independent

---

# What's Functional Programing?

**What's programing paradigm?**

A style of building the structure and elements of computer programs. Common paradiagm includes [1]:
- Imperative
- Declarative
- Object-oriented
- Functional

Note: Paradigm can overlap or can be used w/ each other.

.footnote[[1] [Definition of Programing Paradigms](http://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/paradigms/)]

???

A programming paradigm is a style or “way” of programming. Some languages make
it easy to write in some paradigms but not others.

1. different language is design based on different paradigm and 
2. some principles require the language to implement certain feature. (Go back and talk about these later)

---

# FP Principles

- Treat computation as the evaluation of math functions
- Pure Function
- High-order Function (or Functor)
- Avoid Mutation

## FP Principles

---
template: template-fp-principles

# Treat computation as the<br>evaluation of math functions

A math function maps a set of input to a set of output.

![abs](./imgs/abs.png)

???

Write the math representation of abs on whiteboard

---

# Treat computation as the<br>evaluation of math functions

FP usually prefers expression over statement

```python
# Assume val is int

# Statement
def abs1(val):
  if val < 0:
    return -val
  else:
    return val
  
# Expression
def abs2(val):
  return -val if val < 0 else val
```

---

# Treat computation as the<br>evaluation of math functions

An equivalent Haskell example

--

```haskell
abs :: Int -> Int
abs val
   | val < 0   = -val
   | otherwise = val
```

---

# Treat computation as the<br>evaluation of math functions

FP usually prefers recursion over iteration

```python
# Iteration - Procedural Style
def sum1(nums):
  total = 0
  for num in nums:
    total += num
  return total

# Recursion - Functional Style
def sum2(nums):
   # Not very efficient in Python but you got the idea
   return 0 if len(nums) == 0 else nums[0] + sum2(nums[1:])
```

---

# Treat computation as the<br>evaluation of math functions

An equivalent Haskell example

```haskell
sum :: [Int] -> Int
sum nums = case nums of
  [] -> 0
  x:xs -> x + sum2 xs
```

---

# Pure Function

1. No side effect
2. Same input, same output

---

# Pure Function

**#1 No side effect**

Example of Function w/ Site Effect

--

```python
def sayhi(name)
  print("Hi there, my name is %s" % name)

def write_to_file(file, text):
  with open(file, 'w+') as f:
    f.write(text)

def sort_nums(nums):
  nums.sort() # inplace sort 
  return nums
```

???

No side effect = no observable changes (e.g. print, save to db)

---

# Pure Function

**#1 No side effect**

But why create an app that can't change the "world"?

--

> In practice, applications need to have some side effects. Simon Peyton-Jones,
  a major contributor to the functional programming language Haskell, said the
  following: "In the end, any program must manipulate state. A program that has no
  side effects whatsoever is a kind of black box. All you can tell is that the box
  gets hotter." The key is to limit side effects, clearly identify them, and avoid 
  scattering them throughout the code. [1]

.footnote[[1] [Why are side-effects considered evil in functional programming?](
  http://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/15269/why-are-side-effects-considered-evil-in-functional-programming)]

???

- Think about a space capsule in a unpure universe
- Haskell I/O -> [Monad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkZFtimgAcM&feature=youtu.be&t=22s)

---

# Pure Function

**#2 Same input, same output**

Example of Function that Violates this

--

```javascript
gloabl_counter = 0

function foo(x){
  gloabl_counter += 1;
  return gloabl_counter + x;
}

foo(1) // => 2
foo(1) // => 3
```
--

Other examples?

???

- Here are examples that violate this:
  - Functions that rely on global state (regardless whether it is mutable)
  - Functions that reply on mutable internal state
  - Call by reference - the input parameter reference does not change but the actually value change

Is it a random function possible in pure FP language?

---

# High-order Function (or Functor)

1. Take at least one function as input or 
2. Return a function

---

# High-order Function (or Functor)

**Example: A function that takes another function as input**

```python
nums = [1,2,3]

map(lambda x: x*2, nums)
# => [2,4,6]

filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, nums)
# => [2]

reduce(lambda total, num: total * num, nums)
# => 6
```

???

Use Python to show example as everyone is familiar w/ it.
However, Python does not work well w/ FP

---

# High-order Function (or Functor)

**Example: A function that returns a function as output**

```python
dirs = ['lib', 'bin', 'log']

# `functools` is a built-in Python module
# `functools.partial` return a partial-applied func
func = functools.partial(os.path.join, '/User/jason')

map(func, dirs)
# => ['/User/jason/lib', '/User/jason/bin', '/User/jason/log']
```

---

# High-order Function (or Functor)

Q: Can you do this w/ just lambda?

--

```python
map(lambda dirname: os.path.join('/User/jason', dirname), dirs)
# => ['/User/jason/lib', '/User/jason/bin', '/User/jason/log']
```

---

# High-order Function (or Functor)

Another Example -- **Compose**

```python
def compose(f, g):
  def composed_func(val):
    return g(f(val))
  return composed_func
```

--

```python
dirname = '~/lib/../log' 

os.path.abspath(os.path.expanduser(dirname))
# => /Users/jiamingz/log

expandpath = compose(os.path.expanduser, os.path.abspath)
expandpath(dirname)
expandpath('~/lib/python/..')
```

---

# High-order Function (or Functor)

**Compose** is a common high-order function in FP lang

--

```haskell
add5 :: Int -> Int
add5 x = 5 + x

mul5 :: Int -> Int
mul5 x = 5 * x

mul5_and_add5 :: Int -> Int
mul5_and_add5 = add5 . mul5
```


---

# Avoid Mutation

`[1,2,3]` -> `[1,2,42]`

--

**Example: Mutation**
```python
def change(arr, idx, new_val):
  arr[idx] = new_val
  return arr
```
--

**Example: No Mutation**

```python
def change(arr, idx, new_val):
  return arr[:idx] + [new_val] + arr[idx+1:]

change([1,2,3], 2, 42)
# => [1,2,42]
```

???

Related to the **Pure Function** principle

---

# Avoid Mutation

Wait ... what about the efficiency? 

--

**Persistent data structure**
